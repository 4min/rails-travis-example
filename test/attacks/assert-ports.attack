Feature: check to make sure that the server is starting on the correct port
 
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name       | value        |
      | host       | localhost    |

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected ports
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <host>
      """
    Then the output should match:
      """
      3000/tcp\s+open\s+\w
      """

# For nmap, -F is the fast flag and it looks for the most common open
# ports. To make sure no new ports are opened by your app, you might 
# do something like this:
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#    Then the output should match:
#      """
#      PORT\s+STATE\s+SERVICE
#      8008/tcp\s+open\s+http
#      443/tcp\s+open\s+https
#
#      Nmap done
#      """
