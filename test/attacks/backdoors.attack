Feature: Check for common backdoors that get installed, we should also run this against our running system regularly

Scenario: Using arachni, look for for common backdoors (c99.php, lol.php, shell.php, ...)
Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following profile:
     | name                | value                          |
     | url                 | http://localhost:3000          |
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni --modules=backdoors <url>
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected."
